## 🚀 What is the Piscine?

The **Piscine** (French for *swimming pool*) is an intense, immersive C programming bootcamp that pushes you to your limits.  
No teachers, no courses — just peer learning, collaboration, and raw problem-solving.

This experience taught me:

- 🔹 Shell scripting and UNIX tools
- 🔹 C fundamentals and memory management
- 🔹 Git and version control
- 🔹 Debugging techniques
- 🔹 Teamwork, discipline, and learning to learn
